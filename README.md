### Technologes Used

I want to try and use as many different technologies as I can as well as making sure that they are new to me and I have not used them before.

This will be a full stack web application and will feature the following:
  - *Spring Boot*
  I will use spring boot on the backend. I have never used spring or spring boot before so I decided to go with this as it will require a good degree of new learning.
  - *MongoDB*
  MongoDB is  NoSQL database.
  - *React*
  React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Again I haven't used it before and have read it is in good demand for jobs.
